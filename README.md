# Background
Proptech, the application of technology to real-estate markets, is an innovative domain in the fintech industry. Applications in this domain are used by analyst at 
proptech company that wants to offer an instant, one-click service for people to buy properties and then rent them. We will provide an application for a company to do 
some trial of this offering in the San Francisco real-estate market. If the service proves popular, they can then expand to other markets.

We will be using data visualization skills, including aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the San Francisco 
market that are viable investment opportunities.

This application will be a Jupyter notebook that contains the analysis of the housing rental market data for San Francisco. The analysis will be complete with 
professionally styled and formatted interactive visualizations.
